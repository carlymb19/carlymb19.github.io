            <p class="indent">We offer our condolences to Fancy's dad Michael; Fancy crossed the Rainbow Bridge on January 22nd, 2015. 
                Fancy was the 2013-2014 NAWS Mascot, and attended every event for the last two years. 
                She will be greatly missed by all who knew her. We will remember most what a baby doll Fancy was. 
                Please join us in remembering Fancy, and keeping Michael in our thoughts.</p>

            <h2 class="remembered">Angus the Brave (May 28, 2001 - August, 17, 2009)</h2>
            <div class="indent">
            <h3>Dedicated By: Mary, Larry, and Montgomery Lauber</h3>
            <p>Our beautiful wee Angus was a special boy with a heart of gold. He never tried to be the center of attention 
                but loved being with his brothers. We enjoyed watching him observing his world through his place on the hill 
                in our yard or watching from his favorite chair out the window to his yard. He was a quiet one and only gave 
                an arrooo when someone came into a room and startled him. Otherwise, he was satisfied to let his brothers 
                Montgomery and Duncan sound the alarm but was always there to join in the guard. He would play hard with 
                Montgomery and never backed down. He was an inquisitive but content boy. You could always see in Angus' face 
                a look of interest and wonder about his surroundings often punctuated by his wonderful full head tilt. He loved 
                to investigate and scout out his world.</p>
            <p>When he was first diagnosed with cancer in September 2008, he pulled through his amputation like a trooper. He 
                never missed a beat as he played, ran and frapped with Montgomery. He endured the chemo treatments with no issues 
                and lived his extra days to the fullest. We were so lucky he was able to come to Rally again to see his friends 
                and scout around Door County investigating new places and smells. Even in his last days he would get up and welcome 
                visitors with a wagging tail. He was a gentle, sweet soul.</p>
            <p>We miss our Angus the Brave.</p>

            <h2 class="remembered">Brimstone Belle Starr (April 16, 2000 - April 16, 2009)</h2>
            <h3 class="indent">Dedication By: Melinda M.</h3>
            <p class="indent">She was an amazing dog, 140 pounds of pure heart. She adored me beyond reason, I did not deserve her. But she chose me 
                on a day that seems not long enough ago, leaving mom and grandma and siblings to gallop across the field so she could 
                stand and lean against me. I am glad I trusted her judgment. My life will never be the same.</p>

            <h2 class="remembered">Pete and Molly (February 2009)</h2>
            <p class="indent">Gina and Charlie lost their beloved pets, Pete the cat and Molly the dog in a fire that destroyed their Kansas City North 
                home in Feb. 2009. May Pete and Molly rest in peace, know they were loved, and may their owners be blessed.</p>
            <p class="indent">Our prayers are with all of them.</p>

            <h2 class="remembered">Ellie May (September 2008)</h2>
            <p class="indent">Ellie and her twin brother Jed were orphaned when they were tiny, tiny kittens. My friend and co-worker Barb adopted Ellie 
                May and Jed, and bottle or eye-dropper fed her 2 kittens until they were able to eat on their own. Both grew to be loveable 
                (and large) kitties. They lived with Barb for quite a while, during which they helped Barb fight cancer. Barb lost Jed before 
                she lost her fight with cancer several years ago. Sarah, already the owner of 3 cats, took Ellie in with her feline family, 
                where she lived until her passing last week.</p>

            <h2 class="remembered">Virus Arnold (1998 - 2008)</h2>
            <div class="indent">
            <h3>Dedication By: Goldie & Terry Arnold</h3>
            <p>Virus our 20-year-old gray tabby cat passed away peacefully at 6:05 P.M. on March 6, 2008, after a long battle with father 
                time (and every other neighborhood critter she could catch and drag in the house). The past year she became blind and deaf 
                but continued to lead a loving and productive life. In 1988 I was very sick and in the hospital for a week. The doctors could 
                only tell me, “You have a virus from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet”.</p>
            <p>After coming home to recover, in lieu of flowers, my dear husband, Terry brought me a baby kitten. Thus her name…..Virus. 
                From then on every time someone got a blanket or throw out, boom….she was on your lap. She sensed you needed comfort and she 
                was always willing to give her snuggles and love.</p>
            <p>We were blessed to have her in our family and cherish every wonderful moment. She will now join our other beloved cat Bubba(20), 
                our dogs Brandy(15), Josephine(17), Bud(16), and all the other rescue cats we have had over the years. Long live our beloved pets!</p>
