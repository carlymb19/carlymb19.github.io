                <p>Collars and tags can fall off and can sometimes even harm your pet. Micro-chipping is safe and permanent! 
                    The microchip is about the size of a large grain of rice and is inserted underneath the skin using a syringe 
                    (not unlike a vaccination). If your pet becomes lost, a veterinarian can safely “scan” your pet using a handheld 
                    device to identify your pet and help them find their way back home!</p>

                <h3>The only HUMANE method to help control feral cat over-population.</h3>
                <p>A feral (free roaming cat) is a cat born and raised in the wild who has never had contact, or only very limited
                    contact with humans, or a cat who has been lost or dumped and has turned "wild" in order to survive in their
                    environment. These cats often live-in groups called colonies and they can be found living in secluded wooded
                    areas, suburbs or right in the middle of a city.</p>
                <p>Cats who live in a managed colony that are spayed and neutered, vaccinated against rabies and provided food, water and shelter 
                    (and medical attention when necessary), can live a happy life. However, there will always be risk involved as there are many 
                    dangers associated with any cat living outside. Free roaming cats do NOT pose a danger to people and will usually go out of 
                    their way to avoid contact with people.</p>
                <p>The NAWS Low Cost Spay & Neuter Clinic provides spay, neuter and vaccination services to free roaming/stray
                    cats. All cats also receive a left ear tip as a means of identifying the cat as having been spayed or neutered and vaccinated.</p>

                <h3>Hello, my name is Terry...</h3>
                <p>I am a certified veterinary assistant and a lifelong animal advocate. I have been working with animals as a professional 
                    pet groomer for over 20 years. I also owned and operated three pet supply stores with grooming salons in California.</p>
                <p>I am a little different from most groomers. Instead of dropping them off for the day, you are welcome to stay and watch. 
                    It takes me about an hour to groom most pets. I welcome all kinds of cats and dogs, whether they're timid sweeties or 
                    proud divas. All are welcome!</p>
                <p><span class="important">Grooming services include</span> bathing, haircuts, ear cleaning, nail trimming, comb-outs, hand scissoring, 
                    and more.<br>
